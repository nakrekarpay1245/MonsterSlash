## Game Description
Monster Slash is an exciting puzzle game where you, as the player character, are positioned on a tile grid. Your goal is to select groups of adjacent tiles that contain the same type of monsters and slash them. Once slashed, new monsters will fall from the top and fill the empty tiles. The game progresses through levels, with a limited number of moves available. After successfully slashing a specified number of required monsters within the given moves, you'll advance to the next level. The game also features various weapons that you can use to clear out the monsters and advance to higher levels.
